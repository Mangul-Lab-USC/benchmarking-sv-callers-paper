list of files to be read from text file path_to_pileup.txt

 piCALL: C PROGRAM TO identify INDELS (and SNVs) from population sequence data (at least 10 samples) 
 ./picall -F path_to_pileup_files --rl max_readlength -VCF vcffile.out   > output.log 

=============== PROGRAM OPTIONS ======================================== 

-F : text file with path to a pileup file on each line 
--ref : reference sequence fasta file (same as the one to which reads are aligned, indexed using samtools, optional 
-VCF : VCF file to which the variants will be output 
--rl : maximum readlength, this should be greater than the longest read in the data 
--avgrl : average readlength (for variable length reads, e.g. 454, used for indels) 
--qvoffset QV : quality value offset, 33 for Sanger, 64 for Illumina base qualities 
--mbq : minimum base quality to consider a base for snp calling, default 10
--mmq :minimum read mapping quality to consider a read for snp calling, default 20
--maxm : maximum number of mismatches allowed for read to be considered for variant calling, default value is 3
--LLRthresh : threshold on the likelihood-ratio statistic for calling variant, default is 4
